# ScreepsFactionBackup
This is mainly meant for my code from screeps to be stored on. You will only see the files that are in use here so there may be a few other things you'll need if you want to help me improve my code. :)

# Quick setup held onto for the time being
…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# ScreepsFactionBackup" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/StormWingDelta/ScreepsFactionBackup.git
git push -u origin master
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/StormWingDelta/ScreepsFactionBackup.git
git push -u origin master
…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
